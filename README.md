ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Adam! Iâ€™m a junior Computer Science student at Pennsylvania State University, specializing in Data Science, Analytics, and Machine Learning. I love solving problems with code, data, and algorithms, building predictive models, and developing web applications using Java, JavaScript, React Three.js, SpringBoot, and more.

ðŸ’¡ Some of my projects include forecasting air quality trends, optimizing ML models for California house prices, and building financial systems. Iâ€™m always experimenting with new technologies, sharing insights, and creating cool things along the way.

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and build something awesome!
